## Version 0.9.1 -- TBD

Scope weights are calculated to total weight.

## Version 0.9 -- 2019-08-05

Added scopes, with possibility of assigning "perks", or edge levels, to
the scopes. As a classic example, this allows creating of night vision
and telescopic scopes. The edge levels will be counted towards the
skill checks with the weapon in question.

Allowing specifying range to shoot at with firearms.

Fixed sheet layout to hopefully be more responsive with smaller screens.

Upgraded all top-level npm packages, markedly React, react-bootstrap,
webpack and a bunch of testing libraries.

### Bugfixes

Toughness now correctly counts as two points of body.
