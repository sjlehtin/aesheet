    <p>
        The sheets are equipment and boost sets applied on the base character;
        skills and edges are managed in the sheet view,
        but they are characteristics of the character,
        not of the sheet.  Sheet contains spell effects,
        carried equipment and the like; stuff that may change during a single
        gaming session.  The idea is that you can have multiple sheets for
        a single gaming session, with distinct equipment and boosts.

<h2>Sheet sets</h2>

    <p>Sheet sets combine multiple sheets into a single view, allowing
    quick visibility into the combat actions available as well as damage of
    the combatants.
    </p>
    <p>
    Mostly useful for GM work, but helps also players managing multiple NPCs.
    Sheet sets are user specific.
