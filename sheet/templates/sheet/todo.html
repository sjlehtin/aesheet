<h2>TODO</h2>
<pre>
+ = done
- = not done

Priority list by JW:

+ 0) restrict ammo by chosen weapon dynamically with JS
+ 1) basic skill checks
+ 2) movement rates
- 3) berettas akimbo
+ 4) overland
- 5) spell skill cheks

+ inventory
- damage taken
-- stamina
-- lethal
-- incurred to character, with approriate wounds
-- healing damage
-- bleeding damage, retain original wound, but incurs AA etc penalties
   as per bleeding.

- notes changes should not be logged.

- suspended weight
- marking weapons as having no weight; useful for alternate weapons, or
  weapons with larger sizes (Martel enlarged).

- finalize initial robot tests.

- armor modifiers to skill checks.  These should work for the physical skills
  where the check is shown even without the character having the skill.
- edge skillbonuses back to sheet, they are missing after moving skills to
  react.

- show character height, weight in sheet.
- "add xp used ingame" with a possibility to enter description (to log)
-- if a log entry is added, entry should not be coalesced.
- "add xp" with an optional log entry, allowing for in-game notes.
- shield damages
- tiring
- bootstrap data pop-up links for armor, effects in edit area
-- show basic info.
- reordering weapons.  possible to do with ajax, so it would be faster.

- character addition form layout for easier "intake"
  + group cur, starting stats
  - show raises
+/- adding weapon inplace ("add row" functionality), instead of the large set of
    controls.  Might already be sufficient with the condensed layout, verify with
    JW.


- senses (SM)
- spell skill checks (SM)

- edge levels from items (toughness, darkvision, etc)
+ automatic used edge point calculation

- you should be able to leave current stats empty on character creation,
  in which case the stats would be filled in from the initial stats.

-- xl and e range dependent on user FIT (SM)
-- password change (SM)
+ wondrous items
- magic item location (only one item to each location)
+ change log for sheet (stat modifications etc)
++ skills
-- edges

- code simplification; sheet detail form handling mainly.

- save bonuses (M)
- encumbrance breakdown (M)
- sheet styling

- short description of spell effect (+50 FIT etc)
- stats, armors etc if the character is larger sized.

- Partial skills.  This is a larger item than it sounds, as the current design
  assumes whole skill levels.  Investigate if could be done as a skill level
  model field.

- Inserting None as skill cost to the sheet should work to allow resetting
  skill costs from CSV import.

- creating new objects should be ajaxiced and redirects should occur in a
  sensible manner.

- hardened skin + toughness -> natural weapons durability.
-- NaturalWeaponDura=Aleth+HdSkin+ROUNDDOWN(Toughness/2)+SizeModifier
+ size field for weapons (huge cretin with Large bite)

- free edges based on campaign (probably should think about race
  in this context, for FRP at least)

- it should be really easy to bootstrap the sheet system.  There should be
  some initial data, like tech-levels and campaigns.

Minor:

- adding missing skills (helps in just allowing inserting primary skills
  and autofilling rest)

Firearms:

- using two Berettas akimbo.  Check rule situation regarding instinctive fire.
-- fireams are assigned to hands (right, left, both).  Penalties/bonuses should
   be applied based on weapon type.  If both hands are occupied, apply penalty
   for two guns.
- firearms in CC.

Edges:

+ run speed multiplier
+ climb speed multiplier
- jump distance multiplier
+ swim speed multiplier
+ overland speed multiplier
- superior balance effect on ref/mov balance checks

Skills:

- jumping/tumbling synergy, see AEN skills and edges.

Spells:
+ fly speed multiplier

<h2>BUGS</h2>
<pre>
- Adding skills with multiple prereqs doesn't work.
- Better error messages on importing completely invalid CSV (heading line or
  data type broken)
</pre>
